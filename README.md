# Tutorial Tester Agent

An AI agent that automatically checks the tutorials from the SAP Tutorial system based on quality, relevance and functionality.

## Technical Summary

This project implements an automated agent designed to evaluate SAP tutorials. The agent reads tutorial content, extracts step-by-step instructions, and simulates following those steps in a browser environment. During execution, the agent notes any ambiguities, missing information, or usability issues, and provides feedback for improvement.

Key features:
- **Automated Tutorial Testing:** The agent parses tutorials and interacts with SAP Business Application Studio or similar environments to verify each step.
- **Quality Assessment:** It checks for clarity, completeness, and relevance of instructions.
- **Functionality Validation:** The agent ensures that the tutorial steps can be executed successfully and flags any failures or unclear directions.
- **Feedback Generation:** After completing a tutorial, the agent summarizes its actions and provides constructive feedback for tutorial authors.
